Hi! My name is Michael, and I am a researcher interested in:

- Multisensory Integration
- Body Boundary Perception
- Embodiment
- Psychophysics
- Prediction Error

I started using GitHub for my [undergraduate senior thesis research](https://github.com/mmccoy-01/RTI). I really didn't understand GitHub at first, but I knew it was a programming best practice. I'm more of an experimental researcher than a software developer, but I certainly love being both!

I try to incorporate best data practices into my research. I don't claim to ever truthfully know exactly what I am doing. However, iteratively, I am approaching more closely to the truth. I'd love for you to check out my [website](https://katalepsara.com/) to get a better idea of who I am.
