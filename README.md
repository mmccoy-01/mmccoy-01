# Hi! My name is Michael.

### I'm an experimental researcher primarily interested in:

- Multisensory Integration
- Body Boundary Perception
- Embodiment
- Psychophysics
- Prediction Error
- Neural correlates of consciousness
- Atypical sensory processing disorders (like autism and schizophrenia)

I started using GitHub for my [undergraduate senior thesis research](https://github.com/mmccoy-01/RTI). I really didn't understand GitHub at first, but I knew it was a programming best practice. I stuck with it, and I understand it much better now. I'm more of an experimental researcher than a software developer, but I certainly love being both!

I try to incorporate best data practices into my research for the clarity of posterity. Iteratively, I am asymptotically approaching the truth, yet never fully grasping the truth much like how Tantalus never fully grasped the fruit. I'd love for you to check out my [website](https://katalepsara.com/) to get a better idea of who I am.

Eventually, I'd like to pursue a research-oriented Ph.D. program in behavioral neuroscience studying sensation & perception. If you know of a lab with that opportunity, I'd love for you to get in touch with me!
